# ML-Fraud-Detection-GCP-cloudapi
Fraud Detection model deployed on GCP using AI platform notebooks and API
Fraud detection is a type of anomaly detection, and presents two interesting challenges when it comes to machine learning:

Very imbalanced datasets: because anomalies are, well, anomalies, there are not many of them. ML works best when datasets are balanced, so things can get complicated when outliers make up less than 1% of your data.
Need to explain results: if you're looking for fraudulent activity,Explainability tools can help with this.

**Step 1:** Normalize the data <br />
**Step 2:** Determine class weights <br />
**Step 3:** Train and evaluate the model <br />
**Step 4:** Visualize model metrics <br />
**Step 5:** Copy your saved model directory to a Cloud Storage Bucket. <br />
**Step 6:** Deploy the model on AI and get model explanation <br />
