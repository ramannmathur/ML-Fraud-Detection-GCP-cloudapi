# ML-Fraud-Detection-GCP-cloudapi
Fraud Detection model deployed on GCP using AI platform notebooks and API
Fraud detection is a type of anomaly detection, and presents two interesting challenges when it comes to machine learning:

Very imbalanced datasets: because anomalies are, well, anomalies, there are not many of them. ML works best when datasets are balanced, so things can get complicated when outliers make up less than 1% of your data.
Need to explain results: if you're looking for fraudulent activity,Explainability tools can help with this.

Step 1: Normalize the data
Step 2: Determine class weights
Step 3: Train and evaluate the model
Step 4: Visualize model metrics
Step 5: Copy your saved model directory to a Cloud Storage Bucket.
Step 6: Deploy the model on AI and get model explanation
